# Homework 2: Flow Models

**Due March 31st, 11:59pm on Blackboard**

In this homework, you will implement and train a variety of different flow models.The homework consists of two components:

* `HW2_Flow_Models.ipynb` : Contains all of the coding questions, and will automatically generate and display results for you after completing each question. Open it on Colab by clicking on the file, and then "Open in Colab" at the top. Make sure that you save a copy of the notebook on your own drive to keep your progress. On Colab, download the result images from the left dashboard (folder icon). You will use these images in your report PDF.

* `hw2_latex` :  Contains LaTeX files and figures needed to generate your PDF submission. Copy the images saved from the notebook into the `figures/` folder and fill out the empty test losses. Run `hw2_latex_template.tex` to generate your PDF. 

**What to submit**

* Download a .ipynb version of your notebook.
* Create your PDF report by running the `hw2_latex_template.tex` file.
* ZIP these two files together and submit them to Blackboard by the deadline.

**Important Note**

* `flow_models_demos.ipynb` contains demo codes for the flow models covered in the lectures. You may look at these demos to get an understanding of the implementations. However, it is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to copy codes directly from the demos.
